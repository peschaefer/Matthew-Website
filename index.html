                    <p>Saw this while on my way home from work, but it wasn’t there yesterday. Symbols look familiar,
                        but
                        don’t match up with anything I really know. They match some of the things people have talked
                        about
                        here. I know this site has been quiet for a while, but if anyone lurking has any information,
                        let me
                        know. </p>

                        treating their patients extremely poorly. They did take a picture of three symbols from his
                        cell. It
                        took me a second to find them, but they’re there. Probably going to step away from the site for
                        a
                        while. This is bringing back a lot of bad memories. Hope you all stay safe.

                    <p>@PrinceAsAcademy What sort of spirituality stuff? This is getting scary…I’ve been getting more in
                        touch with my spiritual side. Meeting with local guides, trying to figure out what’s going on. I
                        saw
                        the scar of a symbol on one of the guide’s hands last week. Looked similar to the one Gamb1t

                    <p>Yeah that’s sounding similar to my dad. He was always an atheist and had no interest
                        in any religion or spirituality talk. All of a sudden he’s talking about how much he needs to
                        contribute and allowing his body to be a vessel. Pretty creepy. Hopefully now that you’re aware,

                        subway. I’ve been seeing them places but it’s one of those weird things where I blink then it’s
